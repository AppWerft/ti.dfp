<h3>string adWidth (optional)</h3>
<h3>string adHeight (optional)</h3>
<p>Width and height of desired ad banner (in pixels -- you cannot use unit modifiers here).</p>

<h3>string adBackgroundColor (optional)</h3>
<p>The background color used for the ad.  </p>

e.g. "#ffffff" or "ffffff" are valid.</p>

e.g. "#ffffff" or "ffffff" are valid.</p>

<h3>Array[String] testDevices (optional)</h3>
<p>An array of test device ids. Adding the id of a test device to this array 
will allow that device to be served test ads. </p>
<p>Use the module constant <code>SIMULATOR_ID</code> to use the simulator as a test device. 
If you do not know the id for your device, launch your app and request an ad 
like you normally would, then look in the console for the id. </p>
<p>eg. <Google> To get test ads on this device, call: request.testDevices = @[ @"980bb6fbbb6687047c631fe21136869b" ];</p>
<p>Add the id to the array passed to <code>testDevices</code>.</p>
<h3>object location (optional)</h3>
<p>A dictionary with the location of the user for location-based ads:</p>
<ul>
<li>float latitude</li>
<li>float longitude</li>
<li>float accuracy</li>
</ul>
<h3>object customTargeting (optional)</h3>

<h2>Events</h2>
<h3>ad_received</h3>
<p>Sent when an ad request loaded an ad.  This is a good opportunity to add this
view to the hierarchy if it has not yet been added.  If the ad was received
as a part of the server-side auto refreshing, you can examine the
hasAutoRefreshed property of the view.</p>
<h3>ad_not_received</h3>
<p>Sent when an ad request failed.  Normally this is because no network
connection was available or no ads were available (i.e. no fill).</p>
<h3>ad_opened</h3>
<p>Called when an ad opens an overlay that covers the screen.</p>
<p>Use this opportunity to stop animations, time sensitive interactions, etc.</p>
<h3>ad_closed</h3>
<p>Called when the user is about to return to the application after clicking on an ad.</p>
<p>Use this opportunity to restart anything you may have stopped as part of "ad_opened".</p>
<h3>leave_application</h3>
<p>Called when an ad leaves the application (e.g., to go to the browser).</p>
