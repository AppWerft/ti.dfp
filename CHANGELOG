- Android: Moved most log calls to debug level

- iOS: updated to version 6.12.2 of Google Mobile Ads SDK for iOS

  (note -- I had a 1.0.1 version out there already for ios, but I don't want
  to get the version numbers out of sync for the two platforms, so I'm replacing
  ti.dfp-iphone-1.0.1.zip, which *was* using 6.12.0)
